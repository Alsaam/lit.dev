In this codelab we are going to build analog and digital clock element to get a taste for using a few Lit features in combination:

* Writing a reactive controller
* Dynamically rendering SVG
* Custom styling with CSS shadow parts

Our clock elements will be usable in HTML, and look like the preview on the right

```html
  <digital-clock></digital-clock>
  <analog-clock></analog-clock>
```
