## Render the current time with a digital clock.

First, let's build a simple element to render the current time with a digital clock. We'll start with an existing shell element, `<digital-clock>`, and add a `time` reactive property and a template to render it.

### Add a `time` property

Add a `time` reactive property to the class, just above the `render()` method. We'll set the `attribute` property option to `false` since the type of the property is a Date, which would need to be converted from a string attribute (we'll fix that later).

If you're using TypeScript decorators, you'll need to import the `property` decorator:

```ts
import {customElement, property} from 'lit/decorators.js';
```

```ts
  @property({attribute: false})
  time = new Date();
```

```js
  static properties = {
    time: {}
  };

  constructor() {
    super();
    time = new Date();
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

### Add a template to render the time

Add an expression to the template in the `render()` method to render `this.time`:

```ts
  render() {
    return html`${this.time}`;
  }
```
