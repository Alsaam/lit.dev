## Why Shadow DOM?

You may have noticed that the styles you added in the previous step select any `<rating-element>` on the page as well as any `<button>`. This can result in the styles leaking out of your custom element and styling other nodes that you may not intend to style.

Additionally styles outside of your custom element may unintentionally style the nodes inside the element.

For example, try putting a style tag in the head of the main document:

### index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <script src="./rating-element.js" type="module"></script>
   <style>
     span {
       border: 1px solid red;
     }
   </style>
 </head>
 <body>
   <rating-element></rating-element>
 </body>
</html>
```

Your output should have a red border box around the span for the rating. This is a trivial case, but the lack of DOM encapsulation may result in larger problems for more complex applications. This is where shadow DOM comes in.

In this step you will encapsulate the styles of your custom element with shadow DOM.

## Attaching a Shadow Root

Inside the `connectedCallback()`, attach a shadow root to the element with [`this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'})`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow). The `open` mode means that the shadow content is inspectable and makes the shadow root accessible via `this.shadowRoot`.

### rating-element.<ts-js></ts-js>

```js
connectedCallback() {
  const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});

  ...
}
```

Now your screen will go blank. This is because you the DOM is being attached to the element itself rather than the shadow root. Instead, append the DOM to the shadow root:

```js
connectedCallback() {
  const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});

  shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
    ...
  `;
}
```

Now the red border box should be gone, because the styles in the main document can no longer select the nodes inside the shadow root. But now the styles **inside** the shadow root are wrong, because the `rating-element` CSS selector should now be the shadow root-specific [`:host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host_function) CSS selector. You can read more about shadow DOM styling in the [Lit documentation](/docs/components/styles/#shadow-dom).

Fix the CSS style selectors in the shadow root:

```css
:host {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
}
button {
  background: transparent;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Now take a look at the web component in the Chrome Dev Tools inspector as well:

<img src="/images/tutorials/wc-to-lit/dom-tree.webp" alt="The DOM tree in the chrome inspector. There is a <rating-element> with a #shadow-root (open) as it&rsquo;s child, and the DOM from before inside that shadow root.">

You should now see a shadow root inside your component. You can expand the shadow root to show the contents of the shadow DOM. If you select the `rating-element` in Chrome Dev Tools and call `$0.children` in the console, it should return an empty array of children. The shadow DOM is its own DOM tree, separate from the component's direct children.

## Light DOM

An experiment: add a node as a direct child of the `<rating-element>`:

### index.html

```html
<rating-element>
 <div>
   This is the light DOM!
 </div>
</rating-element>
```

Once the page refreshes, you'll see that the new `<div>` does not show up. This is because shadow DOM has features to control how child nodes—sometimes called *light DOM*—are rendered or *projected* into the shadow DOM.

This tutorial doesn't cover light DOM projection.
