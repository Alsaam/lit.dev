In this step, you will update the DOM every time you change the rating property.

## Property Bindings

Currently, the only way to set the `rating` on the `<rating-element>` is to construct the element, set the `rating` property on the element reference, and then put it on the page. Unfortunately, this is not how native HTML elements tend to work. Native HTML elements tend to update with both property and attribute changes.

Make the custom element update the view when the rating property changes. To do so, first define empty [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) and [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) called `rating`:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
set rating(value: number) {
}

get rating() {
}
```

```js
set rating(value) {
}

get rating() {
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

In the setter, whenever `RatingElement.rating` is set, get the `class="rating"` node with a `querySelector` in the shadow root, and set its `innerText` to the new value.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
set rating(value: number) {
  if (!this.shadowRoot) {
    return;
  }

  const ratingEl = this.shadowRoot.querySelector<HTMLElement>('.rating');

  if (ratingEl) {
    ratingEl.innerText = `${this._rating}`;
  }
}
```

```js
set rating(value) {
  if (!this.shadowRoot) {
    return;
  }

  const ratingEl = this.shadowRoot.querySelector('.rating');

  if (ratingEl) {
    ratingEl.innerText = `${this._rating}`;
  }
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Next, implement the getter by returning a private property called `_rating`, and make sure to update `this._rating` in the setter, whenever `RatingElement.rating` is set.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
private _rating = 0;
set rating(value: number) {
  this._rating = value;
  ...
}

get rating() {
  return this._rating;
}
```

```js
_rating = 0;

set rating(value) {
  this._rating = value;
  ...
}

get rating() {
  return this._rating;
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Now if you were to set the `rating` property on the element, the view will update. Give it a quick test in your Dev Tools console! Inspect the preview window, select the rating element, and set the `rating` property to `5`.

```text
document.querySelector('rating-element').rating = 5
```
