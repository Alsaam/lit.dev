Web componenets are wrapped in React Components and controllers are wrapped in hooks.

It provides the missing support in the React ecosystem for web components and reactive controllers.

The React library has promised web component support.

However, the `React` package is unique from other `Lit` packages.

The `createComponent` function is intentionally designed to be swapped for React's official web component support.
